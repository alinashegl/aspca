fearful and may attempt to hide or become immobile. Most do show at least some sign of social behaviour towards people during the evaluation, however
some are undersocialized to people and only show social behaviour toward them when in the presence of other dogs.
Aggressive C Dogs may (1) show aggression during the majority of the evaluation, in response to multiple situations or stimuli, (2) bite or attempt to bite
at some point during the evaluation or both
C Dogs may need long-term behaviour modification and/or management. Foster care may be necessary for some fearful C Dogs. Adopter counseling
before placement is strongly recommended. Placement restrictions (no young children, no other dogs, experienced owner, etc.) are often appropriate</value>
